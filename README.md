# cpp_projects

Welcome to `cpp_projects`! This repository is a collection of my initial explorations and learning journey in C++. It showcases various concepts and small projects as I build my understanding of the language.

## Contents

This repository is organized into different folders, each representing a distinct phase or project in my C++ learning:

### `day_one/`
This folder contains basic implementations of fundamental C++ concepts. You'll find examples demonstrating:
* **Structs**: How to define and use custom data structures.
* **Recursion**: Practical examples of recursive functions to solve problems.
* And other foundational elements of C++ programming.

### `budget_manager/`
A command-line based budget management application. This project features:
* **Account Authentication**: A simple system for user login.
* **Deposit Functionality**: Add funds to a bank account.
* **Withdrawal Functionality**: Remove funds from a bank account.

### `library_manager/`
This project is a library management system, primarily developed as a practice ground for **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts, especially **classes**. It demonstrates how to model real-world entities (like books and users) using C++ classes and objects.
